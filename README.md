# ColorShift

This project is something that I personally use to generate frames for my avatar gifs, but can also fulfil your 
unrelated color shifting needs.

## How To Use

In order to start the interactive guide, use `python main.py`. If you run `python main.py fast`, an image named '1.png'
will be selected in the specified directory, and will be color-rotated 12 times.
